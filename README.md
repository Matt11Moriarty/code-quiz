# Code Quiz

## Description

This quiz was created as a way to quiz myself and others on their javascript knowledge.
If you can answer all of the questions within the timeframe, you are well on your way to becoming a javascript expert!

In constructing this quiz application, I learned a ton about javascript. 
I now feel exremely confident with the DOM, as well as writing functions, saving data to local storage, and creating/accessing objects.

## User Story
